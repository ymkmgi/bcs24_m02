Database
    - are collection of data that are arranged and organized in a meaningful way

Data vs Information

let theBeatles = ['Richard', 'Gringo', 'Johnny', 'Paul']

let childBirthYear = [1990, 1986, 2023]

let shakespearQuote = 'To be or not to be, that is the question.'

{
    name: "Michael Jordan",
    championships: [1990, 1999, 1996, 2001],
    draftYear: 1984,
    draftPosition: 3
}

Data is a raw input. It does not hold specific meaning

Information is data arranged and holds specific meaning

Database Management System
    - a database management system allows us to manage/manipulate databases. We could perform basic CRUD operations on our databases

What is CRUD?
    - operations that allows us to Create, Read, Update, and Delete

Relational databases
    - allows us to store data or Informationand arrange it in a meaningfully table
    - data is arranged and stores in tables and rows

    id      name    price
    1       PS5     27500
    2       PS4     16000

SQL
    - Structured Query Language. It is typically used to programmatically manage or manipulate a relational database.
    - data is structured and rigid

ERD
    - Entity Relationship Diagram

Mini-Activiti

In the m10 folder, create an activity folder.
Go to diagrams.net and link your professional gmail account.
Using the given set of entities and attributes, create an ERD that will show the relationships between the collections:

Order Products
    Order ID
    Product ID
    Quantity
    Price
    Sub Total

Products
    Name
    Description
    Price
    Stocks
    Is Active?
    SKU

Users
    First Name
    Last Name
    Email
    Password
    Is Admin?
    Mobile Number


Orders
    User Id
    Transaction Date
    Status
    Total

Screenshot the diagram and paste it in our discussion mini-activity
Create a mock data for each of the following collection using JSON syntax.

===============

Data Model
    - describes how data is organized or grouped in a database.

Data Modeling Simulation
    - login
        - users
            - admin
            - users
                - guest users
                - users

Create Data Model
    - users
        - admin
        - customer
            -- first name
            -- last name
            -- email
            -- password
            -- is Admin?
            -- mobile number
            -- enrollments
    - courses
        -- name
        -- description
        -- price
        -- is Active?
        -- enrollees
Relaionships between data models
    - one-to-one
        - a person can only have one employee ID on a given company
        - a student can only have one student ID on a given school
    - one-to-many
        - a perosn can have one or more email addresses
    - many-to-many
        - a book can be written by multiple authors and an author can write multiple books

Translating data models into an ERD
    ERD
        - Entity-relationship-diagram
            - a diagram tool used to describe the structure of the database design. It shows also what attributes(fields) an entity(collection) has.
            - it also shows the relationships of attributes between entities.

===============

SQL
    - Structured Query Language. 
    - It is language used typically in relational DBMS to store, retrive and modify data.
    - data is structured and rigid

SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM students WHERE section = 1;

NoSQL
    - Not only SQL

db.students.find({section = 1}, {id: 1, firstName: 1, lastName: 1})

    - was conceptualize when capturing complex, unstrutured data
        - MongoDB

MongoDB
    - one of the open source databse and the leading NoSQL database, its language is highly expressive and generally friendly to tose familiar with JSON structure
        - "Mongo" in MongoDB is a part of a word "humongous" which means huge or enormous

        - tables ==> collections
        - rows ==> documents
        - columns ==> fields
